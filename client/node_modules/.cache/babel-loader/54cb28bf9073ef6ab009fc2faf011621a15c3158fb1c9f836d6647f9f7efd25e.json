This privacy notice does not apply to the personal information we process as a “data processor” on behalf of our customers. In those situations, the customer that we provide services to and with whom we have entered into a data processing agreement is the “data controller” responsible for your personal information, and we merely process your information on their behalf in accordance with your instructions.

You can withdraw your consent at any time.</p>\n<p>In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way</li>\n<li>For investigations and fraud detection and prevention</li>\n<li>For business transactions provided certain conditions are met</li>\n<li>If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim</li>\n<li>For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin</li>\n<li>If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse</li>\n<li>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</li>\n<li>If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records</li>\n<li>If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced</li>\n<li>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes</li>\n<li>If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>4.

CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>\n<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>\n<h3>14.
